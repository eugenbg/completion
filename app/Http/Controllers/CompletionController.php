Seed Words: student discounts for Annual Coding Conference
Email: Greetings,

I would like to ask if you provide student discounts for tickets to the Annual Coding Conference.

I’m a full-time student at the University of Texas and I’m very excited about your event, but unfortunately, the ticket price is too high for me. I would appreciate if you could offer me an educational discount.

Looking forward to hearing from you!
